This is a repository for an analysis using data directly queried from ICE-D. The code is complete and works locally. 
However, anyone wishing to clone this repo and use it on their own will requre what is referred to in the main code as "db_info"
This imported db_info script is the "read-only" credentials to query data directly from ICE-D and we would prefer to not make
that info publicly available so please email Joe Tulenko (jptulenk@buffalo.edu) if you would like direct access to ICE-D resources
from your personal machine.
